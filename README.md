## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

The application follows a modern React architecture with:

1. **Component-Based Structure**: Modular, reusable components for maintainability
2. **Context API**: Centralized state management for cart, theme, and user data
3. **React Router**: Client-side routing for single-page application experience
4. **API Integration**: RESTful API communication with the backend server

### Integration with Backend Systems

This frontend integrates with two main backend systems:

1. **[YMGS Backend](https://github.com/Sanskargupta0/YMGS-Backend)**: Main API server handling:
   - Product catalog management
   - User authentication and profiles
   - Order processing and payment integration
   - Blog content management
   - Contact form handling

2. **[YMGS Admin Panel](https://github.com/Sanskargupta0/YMGS-Admin)**: Administrative interface for:
   - Product inventory management
   - Order fulfillment and tracking
   - User management
   - Content management (blogs, testimonials)
   - Analytics and reporting

### Data Flow

```

```

## 🚀 Quick Start

Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (version 18.x or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sanskargupta0/YMGS-Frontend.git
cd YMGS-Frontend
```

### Installation

Install dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

or using yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

### Environment Setup

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying from `.env.example`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Fill in all the required environment variables in your `.env` file. See the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section below for detailed instructions.

### Required Backend Setup

Before running the frontend, ensure you have the backend services running:

1. **Set up the [YMGS Backend](https://github.com/Sanskargupta0/YMGS-Backend)**:
   - Clone and set up the backend repository
   - Configure the database and environment variables
   - Start the backend server (typically runs on port 4000)

2. **Set up the [YMGS Admin Panel](https://github.com/Sanskargupta0/YMGS-Admin)** (optional for basic functionality):
   - Clone and set up the admin panel repository
   - Use it to manage products, orders, and content

### Running the Application

1. **Start the development server**:

```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

The frontend will automatically connect to your backend API using the `VITE_BACKEND_URL` environment variable.

## 🔐 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

### Backend Integration
- `VITE_BACKEND_URL`: URL of your YMGS backend server (e.g., `http://localhost:4000` for local development)

### Payment Integration
- `VITE_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`: Your Razorpay key ID for Indian payment processing

### Example `.env` file:
```env
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:4000
VITE_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_xxxxxxxxx
```

**Note**: The backend handles most configuration including Stripe keys, database connections, and other sensitive information. The frontend only needs the backend URL and Razorpay public key.
